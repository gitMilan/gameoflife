// game of life

// the rules:
1: any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by under population
2: any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3: any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction
